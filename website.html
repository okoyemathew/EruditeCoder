    <h2>What is a Website?</h2>
    <p>
        A website is a collection of web pages, which are interlinked. The various web pages are prepared independently, 
        and in the end, they are linked in the required sequence depending on the logical makeup of the information on 
        the site. The link for a web page is basically a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is the address of the 
        computer where the web page is present. Such a collection of related web pages is called a website.
