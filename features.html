    <h2>Features of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        1. Each HTML tag is enclosed within a &lt; (left bracket) and &gt; (right bracket). These special characters differentiate tags from ordinary text.<br>
        2. Opening tags are denoted by, for example, &lt;I&gt;. This is the opening tag to display text in italics.<br>
        3. Closing tags are denoted by, for example, &lt;/I&gt;. This is the closing italics tag.<br>
        4. Tag names are not case sensitive, but as a convention, they are written in upper case to distinguish them from normal text.
