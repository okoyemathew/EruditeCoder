    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>
        In 1980, a markup language was developed to create documents that could be displayed consistently on computers 
        of different hardware and operating systems. It was called the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). On 
        the web, HTML is used to construct formatted pages known as web pages.
